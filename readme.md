DevOps started out as "[Agile Systems Administration](https://newrelic.com/blog/nerd-life/devops-name)". In 2008, at the Agile Conference in Toronto, [Andrew Shafer](https://twitter.com/littleidea) posted an offer to moderate an ad hoc "Birds of a Feather" meeting to discuss the topic of ["Agile Infrastructure"](https://naradacode.com/2020/02/01/devops-history/). Only one person showed up to discuss the topic: Patrick Debois. Their discussions and sharing of ideas with others advanced the concept of "agile systems administration". Debois and Shafer formed an [Agile Systems Administrator group on Google](https://groups.google.com/g/agile-system-administration), with limited success. Patrick Debois did a presentation called ["Infrastructure and Operations"](https://web.archive.org/web/20210205152003/http://www.jedi.be/presentations/agile-infrastructure-agile-2008.pdf) addressing issues around involving more of the company in the same disciplines as programmers.

In 2009, [Patrick Debois](https://twitter.com/patrickdebois) created "DevOpsDays" conference to help to bring it to light. However, it wouldn't begin to [trend until about 2010](https://trends.google.co.uk/trends/explore?date=all&q=devops), when people would begin to describe it as a [standalone discipline](http://www.somic.org/2010/03/02/the-rise-of-devops/).

Today, DevOps goes beyond just developers, systems administration and infrastructure, its about [dev, ops, agile, cloud, open source and business](https://blogs.the451group.com/opensource/2010/03/03/devops-mixing-dev-ops-agile-cloud-open-source-and-business/), everything.

DevOps is a movement. There's [no certificate, role, set of tools or prescriptive process](https://sites.google.com/a/jezhumble.net/devops-manifesto/). There's no specification, it's not a product, or job title. There's no one true voice on what DevOps is or isn't. It's about attitude, ideas, customs and behaviours. Culture, paradigms and philosophy. It's a way of thinking, a way of doing and a way of being. Practicing as well as preaching. It's a conversation. It's about taking the best experiences and sharing those with others.

There are some very important qualities, principles and techniques that have proven to work, that everyone should be aware of, they are the best practices.
 
Let's explore those...
